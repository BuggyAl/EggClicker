# EggClicker [9.0.0-beta1]

Welcome to the EggClicker repository! This repository hosts the Skript code for EggClicker.minehut.gg!

## Recent Updates
### Variable Optimization
Made many server variables into "memory variables" that are not stored if the server is offline. These took up lots of room in the variables.csv file and did not need to be stored.
### Passive Events v1
When players are clicking, there is a rare chance to trigger a passive event.
The current implemented passive events:
- **Eggstravaganza**: 1.5x Egg Production.
- **Token Frenzy**: 1.5x Chance to find Tokens.
- **Teamwork Makes the Dreamwork**: When near another player, gain 1.25x Eggs and 1.25x Token Chance.
- **Cyber Monday**: All shop items are half price.

## Planned Updates
### Passive Events v2
This update will bring more passive events to the game.
The current events planned are:
- **Clicker Boss**: A digital boss will spawn that players can attack by clicking.
- **Lottery**: Players can put eggs and tokens into a pool and one player will win the pool.
- **Witching Hour**: Ability to steal eggs and tokens from other players. *(NOT CONFIRMED)*
## Update Ideas
### AFK / Autoclicker
This update will allow players to gain eggs and tokens while being AFK. This may come in the form of an AFK room or a purchasable and upgradable autoclicker.
### Crates
While clicking, players will rarely find crate keys that can be used to open various crates.
